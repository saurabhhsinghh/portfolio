# portfolio

1. It is a portfolio website.
2. I have included 5 section in it.
3. Nav bar, home, about me,my projects and my services are the 5 sections
4. All of these sections are self explanatory and can be easily made by learning from the documentatios of html,css,bootstrap.
5. Practising a few basic projects and then attempting to make this portfolio website will be the appropriate way to making this website.
